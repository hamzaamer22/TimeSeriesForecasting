# TimeSeriesForecasting
 
Time Series Forecasting Project
Introduction
This project is focused on developing a time series forecasting model using Python. It includes a Streamlit-based user interface (UI) that allows users to interactively upload their datasets, process the data, detect outliers, and apply forecasting techniques to predict future values. The project is designed to be flexible and user-friendly, providing a seamless experience for users to perform time series analysis.
Project Structure
The notebook and Streamlit app follow a structured approach for time series analysis, which includes the following steps:
1. Streamlit UI for Data Upload and Initialization:
   - Users can upload their dataset through an interactive Streamlit UI.
   - The script automatically identifies potential date columns and renames them to a standardized column name (Period) for consistency.

2. Date Format Detection:
   - The notebook and UI include functionality to detect and handle various date formats, ensuring that the date column is correctly parsed into a datetime format.

3. Outlier Detection:
   - Functionality to detect outliers in the time series data is included. Outliers can significantly affect the accuracy of forecasting models, so identifying and handling them is crucial.

4. Time Series Forecasting:
   - The project supports ARIMA and SARIMAX models for forecasting. The application automatically selects the best model based on the data's seasonal strength.
   - Users can generate forecasts directly from the UI, which includes plots comparing the actual and forecasted values.
Installation
To run this project locally, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
•	Numpy
•	Pandas
•	Matplotlib
•	Statsmodels
•	Streamlit


Usage
Running the Streamlit App
1. Start the Streamlit Application:
   - Run the following command in your terminal to start the Streamlit app:

     streamlit run app.py

   - Replace `app.py` with the name of your Python file containing the Streamlit code.

2. Upload Your Data:
   - Use the UI to upload a CSV file containing your time series data.
   - Ensure that your dataset includes a column with date information, as this will be used for the Period column.

3. Select the Column to Forecast:
   - After uploading your data, select the column you wish to forecast from a dropdown menu in the UI.

4. Generate Forecast:
   - Click the 'Generate Forecast' button to run the forecasting process. The app will display the forecasted data alongside the actual data for comparison.
Features
- Streamlit UI: A user-friendly interface for uploading data, selecting columns, and generating forecasts.
- Automatic Date Column Identification: Detects the column with date-like values and converts them into a standard format.
- Date Format Detection: Recognizes various common date formats and converts them accordingly.
- Outlier Detection: Identifies and handles outliers in the time series data to improve forecasting accuracy.
- Grid Search Algorithm: Iterates over multiple possible combinations to find the one providing best results.
- ARIMA and SARIMAX Models: Supports robust time series forecasting methods.
- Interactive Plots: The UI provides plots that compare forecasted data with actual values, giving users clear insights into model performance.
